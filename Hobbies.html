            <p>
                I've been playing Splatoon for awhile and have been enjoying playing it since its release. This
                video is back from a year ago when I made a team with my friend so that we could all play together.
                Currently I'm just playing it for fun whenever I get the chance trying to improve my skills.

            <h3><b><u>Geometry Dash</u></b></h3>
                <p>This game is just a simple rhythm game that I have been playing on and off to improve my reaction skills. I would say I'm decent at it but also that I am improving every and getting better at how to read the levels.
                    One cool thing about the game is that it still gets updates from time to time and that the player base is still pretty active.</p>

            <h3><b><u>Minecraft</u></b></h3>
            <p>
                This game I have played for years and have mostly made it my main game to play for atleast 6 years now.
                I enjoy the creative aspect of it and the exploration, but also that its just a really enjoyable game that I could use to
                express myself and create anything that I wanted. Here is an Song from minecraft which I enjoy.

    <h3><u>Curling</u></h3>
    <p>
        Something else I do most winters is curling. I've been doing it for the last 5 years and enjoy it a lot and play it with my team.<br>I've also played in some tourneys from High School and outside to and won one too. But right now I mostly play it casually<br>
        since I don't have as much time to focus on it as before.
